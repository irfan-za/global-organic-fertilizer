    title: "Vermicompost",
    description:
      "Our vermicompost is a high-quality organic fertilizer produced from worm castings, where the worms are primarily fed with cow manure and occasionally supplemented with chicken manure to enhance nutrient levels. The composting process occurs naturally through microbial and earthworm activity, resulting in a nutrient-rich, environmentally friendly organic fertilizer. To improve handling and application, the vermicompost is processed into granular form—dust-free, non-clumping, and easy to apply across various types of agricultural land. The product is further enriched with: Dolomite (±20%) – to balance soil pH and provide calcium and magnesium. rice husk ash (<10%) – to enhance soil porosity, aeration, and support microbial life. ",
